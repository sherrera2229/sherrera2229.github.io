    <p>Hi, my name is Silvia. I'm very depressed but at least I have Waluigi. He's a God, just like Mr. Flores, Mr. Warford, and Nick, but Nick is only a demi-God right now.</p>
    <p>I've currently started my senior year and I'm convinced I won't be able to get into a good college so I'm honestly just here for the laughs at this point. I have a lot of AP classes and I don't know what I'm doing but I guess the medical field is cool.</p>
    <p>I spend a lot of time harrassing Nick Tortilla. He's Aphrodite but he just doesn't want to admit it.</p>
