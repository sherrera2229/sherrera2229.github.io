    <p>Hi, my name is Silvia. I'm very depressed but at least I have Waluigi. He's a God, just like Mr. Flores, Mr. Warford, and Nick, but Nick is only a demi-God right now.</p>
    <p>I've currently started my senior year and I'm convinced I won't be able to get into a good college so I'm honestly just here for the laughs at this point.</p>
